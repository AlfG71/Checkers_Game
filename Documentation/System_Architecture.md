System Architecture:

The Checkers application will consist of the following components, each serving specific roles and collaborating to deliver a seamless user experience:

1. Front-end (JavaScript):
   - Responsible for rendering the user interface (UI) in the user's browser.
   - Handles user interactions, such as selecting game mode, making moves, and displaying game state.
   - Communicates with the back-end server to exchange data and request game-related actions.

2. Back-end Server (Python):
   - Implements the core game logic, managing the rules and mechanics of the checkers game.
   - Handles user management, including authentication, registration, and storing user profiles.
   - Facilitates communication between the front-end and the database.

3. Database (MySQL):
   - Stores the necessary data for the application, including game data, user profiles, and other relevant information.
   - Provides a reliable and scalable data storage solution for the application's needs.

Interaction Flow:

The application follows the following interaction flow:

1. User Interaction:
   - Users interact with the user interface (UI) rendered by the front-end component in their web browser.
   - They input their name, select the game mode (vs. computer or vs. another human player), and make moves on the game board.

2. Front-end to Back-end Communication:
   - The front-end component communicates with the back-end server using RESTful API calls over HTTP or HTTPS.
   - The front-end sends requests to the back-end for actions such as making moves, registering new users, or retrieving game state.
   - The front-end receives responses from the back-end, including information on the validity of moves, game progress, and other necessary data.

3. Back-end Processing:
   - The back-end server receives requests from the front-end, processes them, and executes the necessary game logic.
   - It validates user moves, enforces game rules, and updates the game state accordingly.
   - The back-end also interacts with the database to store and retrieve game data, user profiles, and other relevant information.

4. Database Interaction:
   - The back-end server interacts with the MySQL database to perform database queries and updates.
   - It stores game data, user profiles, and other relevant information in a structured and secure manner.
   - The database ensures the persistence of data, enabling game resumption, user profile management, and other functionality.

By following this architectural design, our hope is that the Checkers application can provide an engaging user experience while maintaining the necessary data integrity and communication between components.
