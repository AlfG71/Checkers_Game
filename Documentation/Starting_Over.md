**The hows, whys, and whats of creating a web application:**

1. Why are we doing this?
    - The first goal is to create an online checkers game to provide users with an enjoyable and convenient way to play the game remotely.
    - The second goal is to practice new technologies as we develop and implement the game

2. What are the specific business requirements?
   - Identify target audience, expected user base...

3. What are the functional requirements?
     - Multiplayer capabilities, allowing users to play against each other online.
     - User registration and authentication system.
     - Game logic for checkers rules and moves.
     - Real-time updates and notifications for game state changes.
     - Chat functionality for players to communicate.
     - User profiles and statistics tracking.
     - Support for different game variants or rule sets.

4. What are the system design requirements?
     - Front-end development technologies (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks like React, etc.).
     - Back-end development technologies (e.g., programming languages like Python, databases like PostgreSQL, web frameworks like Flask, etc.).
     - Data storage and management (e.g., database design, user and game data storage, etc.).
     - Networking and communication protocols (e.g., WebSocket for real-time updates).
     - Security considerations (e.g., encryption, user authentication, protection against common vulnerabilities, etc.).
     - Scalability and performance requirements?

5. How are we going to test this?
     - Unit testing for individual components and functions.
     - Integration testing to ensure different parts of the application work together.
     - User acceptance testing to validate that the game meets the expected requirements.
     - Performance testing to assess the application's responsiveness under various loads.
     - Security testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

6. How are we going to support this?
     - Documentation for users on how to play the game, create accounts, etc.
     - Helpdesk or support channels for users to report issues or seek assistance.
     - Regular maintenance and updates to address bugs, improve performance, and add new features.

7. How are we going to implement this?
     - Breaking down the project into smaller tasks or user stories.
     - Identifying the technology stack and development tools we plan to use.
     - Setting milestones and deadlines to track progress.
     - Collaborating or working alone?
