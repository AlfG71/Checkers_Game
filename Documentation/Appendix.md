**Appendix:**

This section will include supplementary materials that provide additional information and resources to aid development and enhance understanding.  

*Such as:*

- Code Snippets: 
    - Relevant code snippets or modules that illustrate specific functionalities, 
    algorithms, or key implementation details in the checkers app. These snippets can 
    serve as references or examples for other developers that might want to try 
    working on the project.

- Sample API Requests and Responses: 
    - Sample API requests and responses to help demonstrate the expected format and 
    structure of data exchanged between the front-end and back-end components. This 
    can help people understand the API endpoints, payloads, and expected responses 
    when integrating different parts of the app.

- Database Schema Diagram: 
    - Will include a diagram depicting the database schema or data model used in the 
    application. To help developers understand the relationships between tables, 
    entities, and attributes in the database.

- External Resources: 
    - Will include external resources, tutorials, or documentation that were 
    particularly useful during the development process, providing references or links 
    to these materials. To help developers dive deeper into specific concepts or 
    technologies used in the app.

Our aim is for the appendix section to serve as a supplemental resource for developers, providing them with additional insights, examples, and documentation to aid in the development process. It is not meant to replace the core documentation but rather to complement it with practical examples and references.
