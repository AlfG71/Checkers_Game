**Checkers Game Project**

The process is *always*: 

    1. *Why are we doing this?* 

        The purpose of this project is to build an online checkers game that people 
        can play through a web browser. The project aims to provide a platform for 
        users to enjoy the classic game of checkers, either against a computer 
        opponent or another human player. Additionally, the project serves as an 
        opportunity to learn and practice Python for the back end, JavaScript for the 
        front end, and MySQL for the database. It also aims to improve understanding 
        of the application development lifecycle, practice the Agile process, and 
        create a project to showcase in a profile. Ultimately, the goal is to develop 
        a fully functioning checkers game that can be accessed and enjoyed by users 
        online.
