**Design Choices and Reasoning:**

    In the development process of the checkers application, several design choices 
    will have to be made to ensure its effectiveness, performance, and usability. 
    
    The following are the key design choices and the reasoning behind them:

*Technology Selection:*

- Python: Python was chosen as the back-end language due to its simplicity, versatility, and extensive set of libraries and frameworks. Additionally, Python has a strong developer community and excellent support for web development.

- JavaScript: JavaScript was selected as the front-end language due to its widespread use in web development, allowing for dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It is well-supported across different browsers and provides a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

- MySQL: MySQL was chosen as the database management system due to its reliability, scalability, and wide adoption. It offers robust features for handling structured data and provides efficient query performance.

*Architectural Patterns:*

- Client-Server Architecture: The application follows a client-server architecture, where the front-end (client) interacts with the back-end server to handle game logic, user management, and communication with the database. This architecture allows for a clear separation of concerns and facilitates scalability and maintainability.

*Trade-offs and Considerations:*

- Performance: Consideration was given to the performance requirements of the application. Python, although not as fast as some other languages, provides a balance between development speed and performance. Performance optimizations, such as efficient algorithms and database indexing, will be implemented to ensure optimal response times.

- Usability: The choice of JavaScript for the front-end allows for a responsive and interactive user interface, enhancing the overall user experience. Careful attention will be given to designing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface to ensure ease of use and engagement.

**_NOTE:_** These design choices were made based on a careful evaluation of the project requirements, technical considerations, and the desire to leverage widely adopted technologies. As the development progresses, further refinements and adjustments may be made to these choices to align with emerging requirements and insights gained during the development process.
